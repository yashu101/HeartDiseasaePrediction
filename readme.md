## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning -IET Lucknow

According to World Health Organization statistics, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. CVDs were responsible for 32% of all global deaths in 2019, as estimated by the World Health Organization. Heart attacks and strokes were responsible for 85% of these deaths. Low- and middle-income countries account for more than three quarters of all CVD deaths.

We have created a web application and a prediction model based on machine learning using which a patient can fill in basic details like age, gender, Chest Pain Types, Cholesterol Level, etc. Based on these data, the model is able to predict heart disease. We have used various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN for prediction.User is also able to print the report for tracking the disease.

## Installation
1. Install the Anaconda Python Package
2. Move to the downloaded project directory (Heart Disease Prediction)
3. Create the virtual environment using the below command
	>>conda create -n hdp
4. Activate the virtual environment using the command
	>>conda activate hdp
5. Now install the required libaries using the below command
	>>pip install - requirements.txt
6. Next to train the model open the Jupyter Notebook using the below command
	>>jupyter notebook
7. Open the Heart-Disease-Prediction.ipynb and run all cells
8. Once the training is completed the trained model models.pkl will be stored in the current working directory
9. To run the app open the Anaconda prompt and type the following command
	>>python app.pyÂ 


NOTE:

Before you run the Flask application please run the below command:
	>>pip install Flask
